# Blindtest

This is a very basic application that allows two players in the same LAN play a blindtest game with each others. 
The front-end is with JS and the server side is in nodeJS. 
The music is launched from the "/public/musics" file synchronously via socket.io
Blindtest doesn't use any sophisticated web API.
